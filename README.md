**Intro**

I'm excited to introduce Spots, a new photo sharing site designed to be clean and simple. So far, I've built a majority of the front-end of this site to demonstrate the look and give a peak at the planned functionality of Spots. As you're browsing the design, take a look at the short video below to get a glimpse at its creation. Enjoy!

**Future Development**

I'm excited to add more user interaction to this project, such as button functionality, a profile editing page, and ability for the user to post pictures.
