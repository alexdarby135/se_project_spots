**Intro**

I'm excited to introduce Spots, a new photo sharing site designed to be clean and simple. So far, I've built a majority of the front-end including site structure, styling, and user experience oriented functionality. Enjoy!

**Figma**

This layout was built around [this](https://www.figma.com/file/BBNm2bC3lj8QQMHlnqRsga/Sprint-3-Project-%E2%80%94-Spots?type=design&node-id=2%3A60&mode=design&t=afgNFybdorZO6cQo-1) Figma design.

**Examples**

This [link](https://github.com/alexdarby135/se_project_spots/releases/latest) to screenshots below will demonstrate the overall layout, features such as hover states, and the design's responsiveness to a variety of device viewports.

**Future Development**

I'm excited to add more user interaction to this project, such as button functionality, a profile editing page, and ability for the user to post pictures.
